# TicTacToe With React

Official tutorial from reactjs.org

## Motive: Explore React.

## Functionalities:
-> Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
-> Indicates when a player has won the game,
-> Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
-> Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

## To-Do:
-> Make a Better UI.
-> Moves will be recorded in a panel like chess.
-> last move, next move and latest move buttons, instead of move # list.
-> feature to signup/login and creating private room for online play.
-> keeping score of both players and reset features.
